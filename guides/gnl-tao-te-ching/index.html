<p><strong>Caveat</strong></p>

<p>This document attempts to draw the texts of several popular English translations of Lao Tse into a consistent and accessible context. It is based on the translations of Robert G. Henricks, Lin Yutang, D.C. Lau, Ch&rsquo;u Ta-Kao, Gia-Fu Feng &amp; Jane English, Richard Wilhelm and Aleister Crowley.</p>

<p>This work is not a translation, but an interpolation.  It does not represent the original text; the original, if there was an original, has been jumbled, mistranscribed and reinterpreted many times over many thousands of years, and is here cast into a language that is incapable of presenting its poetic structure and philological connections.</p>

<p>Even an original text, translated as faithfully as possible, might remain inaccessible to the modern reader unable to place it within its original context. The intention of this work is to construct a document that closely corresponds with the best modern translations of Lao Tse, but which is blunt, easy and useful to read within a modern context.</p>
